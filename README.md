Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
We were able to choose from three projects and they were a weight loss app, an inventory app, and an event tracking app. I chose to focus on the inventory application that was meant to help users track items they have. This application was built as a general inventory application that can be used at home, at local businesses, or for office rsources. While tracking the number of items, the application can be configured to notify the user when items are low.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login screen was required to allow many users to manipulate the same list. The primary screen is a list view of the items added to the database with some simple button functions. Once items were added to the list, an edit button and a delete button appear for more simple functionality. Fragments were a key component in this build since the fragments often housed the smaller components of the program such as asking the user for input and asking them to switch on notifications if tney wish.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I spent more time wireframing and building multiple drafts of UI vs drafting out psuedocode for functionality of the application. In the future, I need to spend more time using drafts or basic flowcharts for understanding what approach I want to take. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
After completing small amount of each function, I woud test to ensure the small amount of code had functioned as intentioned. I would also ensure other components were still functioning after additions of code since there were a few times that additions of code may have interferred in other places and caused more bugs go creep in. This process took a bit of time but was super important because whenever a bug went missed for a longer time, these often led to a longer time to correct.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During this process, I created the layout without really undertanding all the parts of android studio. I was more concerned with the look of the application rather than undertanding the parts. When i finally understood what a Recycler View was, I had to commit to either using it or taking it out. This led to more time of learning how Recycler View works as well as the added compnents of code needed to make it work but worked out in the end. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I beieve working with UI components and linking them to the back functions was what I picked up very quickly. Its most likely because these were often more simple than the back end functions but I'm hoping over time I can retain more of the backend building as well.
